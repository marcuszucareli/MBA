# MBA
A place to save my projects developed during my MBA in data science and analytics

# Data Science and Analytics Repository
The purpose of this repository is to save the projects I have developed during my MBA in data science and analytics. Sharing knowledge is a way to learn more about the subjects we are studying.

For each subject, I will build a project related to the topic I'm currently studying.

## Topics
**1. Cluster**

- [Project: A k-means abordage to divide mining areas based on its vegetation](https://github.com/marcuszucareli/image-segmentation-vegetation)
