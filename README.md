A place to save my class notes and projects developed during my MBA in data science and analytics

# Data Science and Analytics Repository
The purpose of this repository is to save my class notes and projects developed during my MBA in data science and analytics. Share knowlodge is a way to learn more about the subjects we are studying.

For each subject I will create a page in Notion with my class notes and also build a project related to the topic I'm currently studying.
